## Business Questions and Solution
Provided below are the questions and answers to the business’s problem:
1.	Total Revenue Generated: 
Excel Formula Syntax =SUM (W2: W9801)  
Returned value = $2,261,536.783
2.	Highest Revenue Generated: 
Excel Formula Syntax =MAX (W2:W9801)  
Returned value = $22,638.480
3.	Lowest Revenue Generated:  Excel Formula Syntax =MIN (W2:W9801)                                                                                                                Returned value = $0.444
4.	Total Numbers of Sales Made:  
Excel Formula Syntax =COUNTA (W2:W9801)

5.	
Returned value = 9800
6.	Number of Cities where the Business Was Located:
Excel formula Syntax =SUMPRODUCT (1/COUNTIF(N2:N9801,N2:N9801)returned value
Returned value = 529 cities
7.	Determine the customers responsible for the highest and lowest sales generated by the company. 
•	The highest customer with sales
Excel formula used is VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_ lookup])  
VLOOKUP (22638.48, H2:L9801, 4, FALSE)
Returned value = SEAN MILLER
•	The lowest customer with sales
Excel formula used is VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_ lookup]) 
VLOOKUP(0.44,H2:L9801,4,FALSE)
Returned value = ZUSCHUSS CARROLL
8.	What is the total revenue generated in “Kentucky”
Excel Formular SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])
= SUMIF(O2:O9801,"Kentucky",V2:V9801)
Returned value = $36,458.39.

## PIVOT TABLES
Pivot tables are one of Excel’s features. It is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amount of data. This is especially useful for querying large data hence making it very valuable for data analysis. In this analysis, the pivot table has been used to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the data. Below we will be showing our values with pivot tables:

## CONCLUSION
In the US superstore dataset, we have examined and analyzed multiple user cases. By visualizing the data, we gained valuable insights into the variation of ship modes and categories among customers, which can be utilized for future improvements. Additionally, we identified the customers who generated the highest and lowest sales and the number of cities where the business is located.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. It is important to ensure that popular items such as phones, chairs, storage, tables, and binder sets are always available and not out of stock.
2. It is advisable to have technology and furniture products readily accessible for customers.
3. In order to stimulate increased purchases, it would be beneficial to offer a discount that is accessible during the holiday season.
4. The advertisements and campaigns should be targeted to prioritize those residing in the top 10 most performing cities.
5. Additionally, discounts should be offered for the least performing products to entice customers to order them.
